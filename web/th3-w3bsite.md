# web/th3-w3bsite

## Problem: 

It's a really simple w3bsite. Nothing much else to say. Be careful though.

Link: [https://th3-w3bsite.hsctf.com/](https://th3-w3bsite.hsctf.com/)

## Solution: 

When we open the website, we see a picture of a pretty nice cat. Let's look around the site to see what we can find on it through Inspect Tools.

Oh ok that was easy. There's actually another way to get the flag though: there's a hyperlink at the top which leads to the flag [here](http://tiny.cc/hsctfFlag).

## Flag:

`flag{1434}`
