## Problem: 

What do these numbers mean?
```
n = 4155782502547623093831518113976094054382827573251453061239
e = 65537
c = 2669292279100633236493181205299328973407167118230741040683
```

## Solution: 

Hopefully you've seen enough basic crypto problems to recognize the letters `n` `e` and `c` in context. This uses RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Encryption, hence the name of the problem.

If you chuck this into [DCode's RSA Decrypter](https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher), this is easy as cake!
